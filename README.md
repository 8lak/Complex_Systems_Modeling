# Modeling Behavioral Dynamics: A Systems Approach
This project is a multi-disciplinary exploration into modeling complex, adaptive systems, using my own daily behavior as the primary case study. The ultimate goal is to develop a computational framework for understanding and predicting the emergent patterns of a human consciousness.
## Project Evolution
This repository began as Mindustry_Base_Optimizer, an attempt to solve a constrained routing problem in a game using techniques like Graph Theory and Simulated Annealing. This initial work served as the foundation for a much deeper inquiry: Can the same principles used to optimize a system of resources be used to model the "internal resource management" of the human mind?
This project now focuses on answering that question, drawing on concepts from:
- Reinforcement Learning (RL): To model the subconscious, habit-forming agent.
- Time-Series Analysis: To analyze the daily log of behavioral and physiological data.
- Spectral Graph Theory (SGT): To identify the dominant "modes" or "eigen-habits" of the system.
- Dynamical Systems & Thermodynamics: To explore concepts like attractor states, system stability, and free energy.

## Current Phase: Data Collection & Foundational Modeling
I am currently in the process of:
Collecting daily time-series data via a structured logging system.
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib).
Building a baseline predictive model to serve as a benchmark.
The folders from the original "Mindustry" phase have been archived but are kept here to document the project's intellectual lineage.
