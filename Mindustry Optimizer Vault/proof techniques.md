**The General Algorithm for Proving a Bound**

Suppose you want to prove that for some complicated expressions $Expression_A and Expression_B$ (which are our Numerator and Denominator), there is a bound $Expression_A / Expression_B ≤ C$.

The strategy is a three-step hunt:

1. **Analyze the Structures:**
    - Look at the fundament "building block" of $Expression_A$. In our case, it was $(a - b)²$.
    - Look at the fundamental "building block" of $Expression_B$. In our case, it was $c²$ (since the denominator is a sum of squared terms).
2. **The Creative Search for a "Bridge Inequality":**  
    This is the core intellectual step. You must find a "tool" – a universal inequality – that meets two strict conditions:
    - **Condition A (Universality):** It must be true for all possible values of its variables.
    - **Condition B (The Bridge):** It must connect the building block of $Expression_A$ to the building block of $Expression_B$. It must look something like:  
        $Structure of A ≤ K * A structure that can be transformed into B$  
        (where K is some constant)
3. **Apply and Simplify:**
    - Use your chosen "Bridge Inequality" to create an upper bound for $Expression_A$.
    - Perform the necessary algebraic manipulations (like the "counting in two ways" trick) to show that this upper bound is equal to $C * Expression_B$.
    - This proves $Expression_A ≤ C * Expression_B$, which gives you the final definite bound $Expression_A / Expression_B ≤ C$.
