Geometric development of SGT like in expander graphs, these are based on eigenvalues and isoperimetric properties of graphs, Cheeger inequality for exploring random walks and randomly mixing markov chains. Particular developments can be seen in SGT and differential geometry 

Eigen values are closely related to all invariant properties of a graph linking extremal properties to each other. 

Eigenvalues will be defined in a general and normalized form that lends itself well to the definitions in spectral geometry and stochastic processes. More explicitly it defines the eigenvalues in regards to the Normalized Laplacian matrix [[Laplacian Matrices]] vs the default Laplacian. Particularly in the generalization of eigenvalues for general graphs. (Regular vs General: Regular = all vertices have the same degree, General = have arbitrary degrees) the Normalized Laplacian has degree weighting so it becomes a standardized matrix such that the retrieval of eigenvalues is not skewed and can be used as a generalized form for general graphs.
