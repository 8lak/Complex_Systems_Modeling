Isomorphism: Is that two graphs are structurally identical such that the vertex set 1 maps 1:1 to vertex set 2, The Spectral implications for this are that they share the same spectra, formally known as cospectral, however graph sharing the same spectra doesn't imply being isomorphic. Non-isomorphic just implies structural difference and are called cospectral non-isomorphic. 

Automorphism is when given a graph we apply a permutation to it and it results in an isomorphic relationship. This maintains the same spectra properties. However it also supports similar eigen vectors since the permutation is just a manipulation of the graph in the same space we can say that the eigen vectors have simply been scaled. There is the idea of degenerate eigen values and simple and **intuition** on the degenerate spaces is that they relate to the overdetermine system or linear dependence and automorphism may imply some liberty with the basis to be chosen or that some pruning or reduction of edges can be possible. Might have to explore the implications of automorphism more later.
