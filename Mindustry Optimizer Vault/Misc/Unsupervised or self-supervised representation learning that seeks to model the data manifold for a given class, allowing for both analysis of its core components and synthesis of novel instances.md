1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
    
    - **The Idea:** Instead of just classifying, you train two models. A **Generator** tries to create realistic fake images (learning the true data distribution), and a **Discriminator** tries to tell the real images from the fake ones. This is the ultimate "learning the distribution of structures."
        
    - **Where to Start:** Look up the original "DCGAN" (Deep Convolutional GAN) paper or tutorials that implement one for datasets like MNIST or CIFAR.
        
2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**
    
    - **The Idea:** This is a more probabilistic approach. A VAE learns to encode an image not into a single point, but into a distribution in a lower-dimensional "latent space." It then learns to decode from a point sampled from that distribution back into a realistic image. It explicitly models the "distribution of possible ways" you could represent an image.
        
    - **Where to Start:** VAEs are conceptually dense but very powerful. Finding a well-explained PyTorch implementation is key.
        
3. **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):**
    
    - **The Idea:** This is one of the hottest areas in AI. How do you learn good "basis features" (the job of the CNN) without using any labels at all? SSL methods create their own labels from the data itself. For example, you might take an image, crop two random patches from it, and train a network to recognize that these two different patches came from the same source image. The network is forced to learn what makes an image "itself"—its fundamental structure and style—without ever being told "this is a cat."
        
    - **Where to Start:** Look into methods like **SimCLR**, **MoCo**, or **BYOL**.
        
4. **Knowledge Distillation:**
    
    - **The Idea:** Train a massive, powerful "teacher" model. Then, train a smaller, more efficient "student" model. The student's goal is not to predict the hard labels, but to match the rich probability distribution output by the teacher. The student learns the teacher's "nuance" and "hesitation," which is a richer signal than the ground truth alone.
        
    - **Where to Start:** Look for Geoffrey Hinton's original paper on the topic or tutorials that implement a simple teacher-student setup.
