[[Graph Theory]]

A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set. In simpler terms, you can split the vertices into two groups, and no two vertices within the same group are connected by an edge.
